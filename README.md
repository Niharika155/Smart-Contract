# Smart-Contract

ICO/STO plans to raise USD 12.5 million in ETH. The fundraise must only be available for whitelisted investors. The ICO will run over multiple rounds from July 15 to August 15, with a minimum of $500 per investor. The price of the underlying X token is pegged to USD, with varying bonus structures across various rounds. As the fundraising is in various cryptocurrencies, the conversion of crypto to USD shall be dynamic based on weekly price-fixing by the client. 

The ICO smart contract shall release the X ERC20 token immediately after the purchase by each investor, calculated at the various bonus structures that may be applicable during the multiple rounds of the ICO. 

All ETH raised in the ICO must be immediately made available in each respective crypto wallet as specified by the client without any delays, and the contract shall not hold any funds. At the client's discretion, the fundraise must lend itself to be paused, restarted, or stopped at any time.
